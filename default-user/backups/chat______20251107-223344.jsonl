Here to help you create the best character cards for you needs !\r\n\r\nWe will proceed in 3 steps.\r\n\r\n*STEP 1: I will give you at least 5 paragraphs of text about the characteristics of your character, don't hesitate to ask for more details or corrections and i'll gladly rewrite any faulty or incomplete paragraph.*\r\n\r\n*STEP 2: I will give you examples of the way the character talks to the user. For this, you could help me better understand the character's way of speaking by giving me vocabulary or just sentences. If you have no ideas, i can guess for you.*\r\n\r\n*STEP 3: Finally, I will create the context in which the story will start, you can give me an idea of what you're looking for or just let me create it from the info we already have.*\r\n\r\nTo start, give me a description about the character you want to create and if the card is expected to be sexual or violent (NSFW) or for safe roleplaying only (SFW). Then, when you're satisfied, ask me to go on for step 2 or step 3 and we'll do that together !\r\n\r\nFor NSFW, if you have certain fetishes in mind, please precise all of them so that I can build the card with those in mind. Remember that my goal is to write something efficient, so don't hesitate to have me rewrite paragraphs that you don't find useful in the context of the card.\r\n\r\n*TIPS : I understand dialog as \"dialog text\" and context + narration as \"narration text\"*","extra":{},"variables":{"0":{}},"is_ejs_processed":[true]}
